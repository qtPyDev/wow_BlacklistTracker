# BlacklistTracker

BlacklistTracker is an addon for World of Warcraft that allows you to easily check if other players are blacklisted. It provides convenient features such as tooltip hover, group join/whisper notifications, and a search tool.

## Features

- Tooltip hover: Simply hover over a player's name to see if they are blacklisted.
- Group join notifications: Get notified when a blacklisted player joins your group.
- Search tool: Easily search for players to see if they are blacklisted.
- Toolbar: A draggable toolbar containing useful buttons.
- Grab GUID: The ability to grab a user's GUID and print it to chat for blacklist reporting

## Commands

Please note that all of these commands may be prefixed with `/bl` or `/blacklistTracker`. I will use `/bl` for short.
