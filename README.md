# BlacklistTracker

BlacklistTracker is an addon for World of Warcraft that allows you to easily check if other players are blacklisted. It provides convenient features such as tooltip hover, group join/whisper notifications, and a search tool.

## Features

- Tooltip hover: Simply hover over a player's name to see if they are blacklisted.
- Group join/whisper notifications: Get notified when a blacklisted player joins your group or sends you a whisper.
- Search tool: Easily search for players to see if they are blacklisted.

## Commands

Please note that all of these commands may be prefixed with `/bl` or `/blacklistTracker`. I will use `/bl` for short.

- `/bl help`: Display a list of available commands.
- `/bl` or `/bl toggle`: Opens the BlacklistTracker GUI which will list the version, and details about the app and author.
- `/bl version`: Returns the Version Number of the Addon. Useful for bug reporting or ensuring you are on the latest version!
- `/bl find {name}` or `/bl search {name}`: Scans through the blacklist for the name given, and will return a system message either with details if the user is blacklisted, or that the user has not been found.
- `/bl search {name}`: Scans through the blacklist

## Important Note
